CourseTest.cpp: the code used to test the Course class.
testInstr.cpp: code used to test the instructionType class
instrPointerTest.cpp: test the breakDown function, which reads a Course pointer and construct the corresponding 
			instructionType objects (Ex: pointer to CS265 will generate instructionType objects named
			CS265Lab and CS265Lecture).
sched.cpp: the grand test for the scheduling algorithm.

All the file has been runned successfully and the results are all positive. If time permits, we can modify the tested
files using more pointers for better memory management.
